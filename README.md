### Blockchain technology (Case Study for exams 2020)

### Introduction

Santa Monica is typical of many towns around the world. Over the past few decades the population has declined and many local businesses have closed. When the people of Santa Monica spend their pesos in the stores owned by multinational companies, the money leaves the town.

Pablo, the mayor, wants to reverse this process. He has investigated **towns that have created their own local currency**, and thinks that this is an idea that could work in Santa Monica. He found that these local currencies worked alongside the national currency. For example, one unit of the local currency would equal one peso. The local currency also had no value outside of the local area, so it could not be exchanged for other currencies, such as US dollars. However, if adopted in Santa Monica, citizens would be able to change the new local currency back to pesos whenever they wanted.

Pablo’s investigations showed that once a local currency had become established it brought considerable benefits to a town. Local businesses had more customers and were able to provide discounts for those who decided to use the new local currency. Many local workers saw the benefits of using the local currency and decided to accept some of their salary in it. However, many of these local currencies failed because of the administration costs they incurred, such as the cost of printing notes, combating fraud and providing additional banking services.

One Santa Monica resident, Dolores, a local computer science graduate, has suggested a way to overcome these problems. She has explained that “a **cryptocurrency based on blockchain** could help Santa Monica to avoid these problems because it doesn’t require any central administration. People who don’t know each other can transact without any need for a central authority, and that will remove these costs”. Pablo and Dolores have decided that the next step would be to promote the idea of a new cryptocurrency, called **MONS**, for Santa Monica.
